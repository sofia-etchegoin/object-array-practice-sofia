# Object-array-practice

This is a self-assessment to help you understand how you're doing with the content and main take-aways from week 1 of bootcamp. Each task will display artist, releases, and listener data in various ways inside the terminal.

## Setup
<details>
  <summary>Installation & what's included</summary>

  <h3>Installation</h3>
  
  In a process that may be growing familiar by now, clone this repo, navigate into it, and install packages using `npm i` or `npm install`.

  <h3>What's included</h3>

  - `data/*.js`: the data we'll use in `index.js`
  - `task.js`: where we'll write the functions that complete the tasks below
  - `tasks.test.js`: where we'll write the tests for the functions in `tasks.js`
  - `index.js`: where we'll call the functions written in `tasks.js` so we can see the output
</details>

## Recommendations

- Try to write the tests first
- The functions in `tasks.js` should receive the data as parameters and return the necessary data rather than access the data directly. This will make them easier to test
- Remember to stage and commit your changes after each task
